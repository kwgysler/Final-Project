# Final-Project 

KG: I have constructed most of the skeleton for the project.

KG: I wrote the sub-VI to calculate the closest note being played, have not tested yet.

KG: I need to finish up figuring out how to layer the exp data with the saved data (I think I have it, just need to test)

KG: I kinda figured out the microphone set up, there's just a lot of noise and the sampling rate is off so it's not yet very useful.


KG: We still need to figure out Fourier analysis and waveform. Possibly how to keep data sampled over a period of time, or we can filter/smooth it.
