# Final-Project 

This is an instrument tuner/harmonic analyzer.

The front panel contains a tuner that also displays the current note frequency and makes an estimation of intended note, 
giving the difference in cents on a meter.

The second panel shows the relative intensities of the harmonics for the current instrument. It attempts to identify the
source and can display harmonic data for other instruments.

The third panel shows a power spectrum over time for the input sound.
